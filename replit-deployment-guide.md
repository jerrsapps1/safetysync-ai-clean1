# Finding Your Replit Deployment Information

## Step 1: Locate Your Deployment Settings

### Method 1: Through Replit Dashboard
1. Go to your Replit dashboard
2. Click on your SafetySync.AI project
3. Look for one of these tabs/sections:
   - **"Deployments"** tab
   - **"Domains"** section
   - **"Custom Domain"** option
   - **"Settings"** → "Domains"

### Method 2: Check Your Current URL
Your Replit app is currently running at a URL like:
- `https://[project-name]--[username].repl.co`
- `https://[project-name].[username].repl.co`

This URL can be used as your CNAME target.

## Step 2: What to Look For

### If You See a Custom Domain Section:
- Look for "Add Custom Domain" button
- Click it and add `safetysync.ai`
- Replit will show you either:
  - An IP address (for A records)
  - A CNAME target (for CNAME records)

### If You Don't See Custom Domain Options:
You can still use your current Replit URL as a CNAME target.

## Step 3: Alternative Methods

### Method A: Use Your Current Replit URL
If your app is running at `https://safetysync-ai--yourusername.repl.co`, you can use:
```
CNAME: safetysync.ai → safetysync-ai--yourusername.repl.co
```

### Method B: Contact Replit Support
- Go to Replit Help Center
- Ask about custom domain setup for your plan
- They can provide specific instructions

### Method C: Use DNS Redirect
Many domain registrars offer URL forwarding:
1. Set up URL forwarding from `safetysync.ai` to your Replit URL
2. This is a temporary solution while you set up proper DNS

## Step 4: Current Status Check

Let's check what your current Replit URL is:
- Look in your browser address bar when viewing your app
- This is the URL we can use for initial setup

## Step 5: Replit Plan Requirements

### Free Plan:
- May not include custom domain support
- Can use URL forwarding as alternative

### Paid Plans:
- Usually include custom domain support
- Look for "Deployments" or "Domains" in your dashboard

## Next Steps

1. **Find Your Current URL**: Check your browser when viewing the app
2. **Check Replit Plan**: Verify if custom domains are included
3. **Use Temporary Solution**: Set up URL forwarding if needed
4. **Contact Support**: If you can't find domain settings

## Quick Commands to Test

Once you have your URL, test it:
```bash
# Test your current Replit URL
curl -I https://your-replit-url.repl.co

# Check DNS after setup
dig safetysync.ai
```

## Common Replit URLs Patterns:
- `https://project-name--username.repl.co`
- `https://project-name.username.repl.co`
- `https://repl-name.username.repl.co`

The exact pattern depends on your Replit setup and plan.
