Great — with asbestos, lead, mold, and demolition work, your company falls under some of the most tightly regulated training requirements in construction under 29 CFR 1926 and applicable EPA rules (especially for asbestos and lead). Here’s how I’ll tailor the templates and checklists for perfect OSHA compliance in your case.

🗂️ PART 2: Recordkeeping Checklist (Inspector’s View)
Every training record should contain:

✅ Employee full name and ID

✅ Date of training

✅ Name and qualifications of trainer

✅ Topic and applicable OSHA/EPA standard

✅ Mode of delivery (classroom, field, LMS)

✅ Test scores or sign-off proving competency

✅ Expiration/renewal dates (where applicable)

✅ Sign-in sheets (if live training)

✅ Copies of certificates for licensed programs (e.g., EPA Asbestos/Lead)

I’ll check:

Random employee records by name/job

If expired certs are still active

If workers on-site can recall key hazards/training
