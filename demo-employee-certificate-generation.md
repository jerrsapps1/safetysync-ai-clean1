# Employee Certificate Generation Demo

This document demonstrates how the new employee-centric certificate generation system works.

## Key Features

### 1. Employee-Centric Approach
- All certificates are stored with individual employee profiles
- Each employee has their own certificate collection
- QR codes link directly to employee certificates for real-world verification

### 2. Automatic Certificate Generation
When generating certificates through the platform:
- Certificate files are created as before
- Additionally, certificates are automatically stored in employee profiles
- QR codes are generated for public access without signin
- Wallet cards are created for mobile viewing

### 3. Public QR Code Access
- QR codes on employee hard hats allow instant certificate verification
- No signin required for safety personnel to verify training
- Direct access to employee certificate collection via QR scanning

## API Endpoints

### Generate Certificate for Employee
```
POST /api/certificates/generate-for-employee
```

Body:
```json
{
  "employeeId": 1,
  "employeeName": "John Smith",
  "employeeIdString": "EMP001",
  "trainingName": "Fall Protection Training",
  "completionDate": "2025-07-20",
  "instructorName": "Sarah Johnson",
  "instructorCredentials": "CIH, CSP, OSHA Authorized",
  "location": "Training Center A",
  "duration": "4 hours",
  "companyName": "SafetySync.AI"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "certificate": { ... },
  "certificateUrl": "/uploads/certificates/certificate_EMP001_1752980435123.html",
  "walletCardUrl": "/uploads/wallet-cards/wallet_card_EMP001_1752980435123.html",
  "certificateNumber": "CERT-98035123456",
  "expiryDate": "July 20, 2026"
}
```

### Access Employee Certificates via QR Code
```
GET /employee-certs/{qrCodeData}
```

This endpoint allows public access to employee certificates without authentication.

## Workspace Integration

### Employee Profile Tab
- New "Employee Profile" tab in workspace navigation
- Select employee from grid view
- View and manage all certificates for that employee
- QR code generation for public access

### Certificate Management Features
- View all certificates for an employee
- Edit certificate names and notes
- Remove expired certificates
- Copy/paste certificates between employees
- Upload external certificates
- Download individual certificates

## Real-World Use Case

1. Employee wears hard hat with QR code sticker
2. Safety supervisor scans QR code with phone
3. Instantly sees all certificates for that employee
4. Verifies training without needing platform access
5. No signin required - immediate verification

## Database Schema

### Employees Table
- Stores basic employee information
- Links to user account for access control

### Employee Certificates Table
- Stores all certificates for each employee
- Includes certificate files, wallet cards, QR codes
- Tracks status (active/expired/revoked)
- Links to specific employee and user

### Employee QR Codes Table
- Unique QR codes for each employee
- Public access without authentication
- Links directly to employee certificate collection

## Implementation Status

✅ Database schema created and migrated
✅ Employee Profile component built
✅ Employee Certificate API endpoints created
✅ QR code generation system implemented
✅ Public certificate access created
✅ Workspace navigation integration added
✅ Certificate generation service created

The system is now ready for real-world deployment where employees can carry QR codes for instant certificate verification by safety personnel.
